# Grofit
This discord project is used to monitor text channels and remove messages that do not follow a standard format.

It uses 2 regular expressions to decide if the format is respected. The "white" regex must match in the message for it to be tolerated. The "black" regex must not hit anywhere for the message to be tolerated. A message is only tolerated if both the white and black regex pass their test.

## Install
1. Install node.js on your machine
2. Clone this directory
3. Create a "key.txt" file in the root folder and write the discord login token of your bot.
4. Create a "owner.txt" file in the root folder and write the discord id of the bot owner.
